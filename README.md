# Stand Lab

Personal Stand Lab v19 release.

## Load

Paste this into your compatible Lua runner:

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JeremyInk/stand-lab/main/main.lua"))()
```

The runner must support `game:HttpGet` and `loadstring`, plus the capabilities used by the full script. This is not a standard Roblox Studio LocalScript loader.

The loader downloads `main.lua` from this repository. Updating that file updates what the loader runs next time. A short loader reduces editor text; the complete script still downloads and executes, so it does not itself reduce runtime memory or lag.

## Release status

v19 addresses the observed dialogue handler registration race. The release passed compilation and 31 offline check groups during preparation; the latest fix still needs live testing. Existing diagnostic logging remains available inside the UI.

## Attribution

Stand Lab customizes the recovered Methion gameplay/UI integration credited in the source to Diablo/redikXrbs and bundles the inspected Methion Airflow UI library. Existing source attribution is retained. The inspected UI source was https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Methions/modf/refs/heads/main/cva.

Only release code, this README, the loader, and checksums are included. No local session reports, screenshots, or credentials are included.
